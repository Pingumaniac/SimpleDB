## About this project
* Based on ”Database Design and Implementation” by Edward Sciore.
* Modified from the existing implementation of SimpleDB based on the programming exercises: http://cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/
* Designed and implemented a SimpleDB relational database (SQL) using JDBC to connect a Java program.
* Developed the core components of a database engine, including indexing, sorting, intelligent buffer management, and query optimization techniques for efficient query processing.
* Leveraged JDBC to establish a seamless connection between a Java application and the SimpleDB database.
* Implemented efficient query processing strategies to optimize database performance and ensure timely data retrieval.
* Technologies used: Java, JDBC
